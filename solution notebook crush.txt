Restart the Kernel: Go to the Kernel menu and select "Restart." This often resolves temporary issues.

Check Your Code: Look for potential infinite loops or memory-intensive operations. Consider breaking your code into smaller chunks to identify where the issue occurs.

Monitor System Resources: Use system monitoring tools (like Task Manager on Windows or Activity Monitor on macOS) to check memory and CPU usage when the notebook runs.

Simplify Your Code: If youâ€™re loading large datasets or models, try reducing the size or complexity temporarily to see if the crash still occurs.

Update or Reinstall Libraries: Make sure all libraries and dependencies are up-to-date. You can try reinstalling them if you suspect corruption.
